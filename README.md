# Policy Remover
I need help. Chrome enterprise policies are being dumb and not allowing devtools or linux.
My school has really strict policies and I don't know how to remove any of it.
Heck, they disabled the dinosaur game!
I really don't know how to disable this stuff on Chrome OS without crosh, linux, or devtools.
I don't have an admin login either.
I need to work with @therock17000 on this, because we're tired of the management.
If anyone knows what I can do, please contribute here.
